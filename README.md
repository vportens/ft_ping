## Project Overview

Remake the commande ping with ipv4 address, 
We take the ping implementation from inetutils-2.0 as our source.

## What I learned

- manage a simple IPv4 (address/hostname) as parameters.
- manage FQDN without doing the DNS resolution in the packet return.
- Who to communicate on the internet network in C
